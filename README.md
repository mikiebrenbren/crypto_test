# Kraken Crypto/Payments Hiring Test

At Kraken, we receive thousands of deposits from customers per day. This test is designed to test your ability to work with a transaction set that could get returned by a blockchain daemon like bitcoind.

The data we work with in this scenario comes from bitcoindâ€™s rpc call `listsinceblock`. A frequently used approach to detect incoming deposits is to periodically call `listsinceblock` and process the returned data. This test contains 2 json files that represent the data from 2 separate calls to this endpoint. Your task is to write code that processes those files and detects all valid incoming deposits.

These instructions do not specify every single detail you should take into consideration. This is done on purpose to test your ability to analyze a problem and come up with a reasonable and safe approach. Keep in mind that your code will determine how much money each customer will get. Thoroughness is one of the most important qualities for this role.

**Goal**: Process transactions and filter them for valid deposits.

**Note**: A deposit is considered valid when it has at least 6 confirmations.

Known customer addresses are:
* Wesley Crusher: mvd6qFeVkqH6MNAS2Y2cLifbdaX5XUkbZJ
* Leonard McCoy: mmFFG4jqAtw9MoCC88hw5FNfreQWuEHADp
* Jonathan Archer: mzzg8fvHXydKs8j9D2a8t7KpSXpGgAnk4n
* Jadzia Dax: 2N1SP7r92ZZJvYKG2oNtzPwYnzw62up7mTo
* Montgomery Scott: mutrAf4usv3HKNdpLwVD4ow2oLArL6Rez8
* James T. Kirk: miTHhiX3iFhVnAEecLjybxvV5g8mKYTtnM
* Spock: mvcyJMiAcSXKAEsQxbW9TYZ369rsMG6rVV

## Requirements

Build a dockerized Node.js application to process the two transaction sets. 

If you're not comfortable with Node.js, feel free to use the language of your choice.

The command `docker-compose up` **MUST**:

1. Read all transactions from `transactions-1.json` and `transactions-2.json` and store all deposits in a database of your choice.
2. Read deposits from the database that are good to credit to users and print the following 8 lines on stdout:

    ```
    Deposited for Wesley Crusher: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for Leonard McCoy: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for Jonathan Archer: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for Jadzia Dax: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for Montgomery Scott: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for James T. Kirk: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited for Spock: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Deposited without reference: count=n sum=x.xxxxxxxx
    Smallest valid deposit: x.xxxxxxxx
    Largest valid deposit: x.xxxxxxxx
    ```

    The numbers in lines 1 - 7 **MUST** contain the count of valid deposits and their sum for the respective customer.
    
    The numbers in line 8 **MUST** be the count and the sum of the valid deposits to addresses that are not associated with a known customer.

    **Note**: We'll match for these 10 lines with regular expressions. Please stick to this exact template, otherwise it won't be detected.

## Submitting your results

Compress your source code as zip archive and send us a link where we can download it. Sharing via Dropbox or Google Drive has worked well in the past. Make sure the Dockerfile is on the top level.

## bitcoin-cli api doc for listsinceblock 
```bash
listsinceblock ( "blockhash" target_confirmations include_watchonly include_removed )

Get all transactions in blocks since block [blockhash], or all transactions if omitted.
If "blockhash" is no longer a part of the main chain, transactions from the fork point onward are included.
Additionally, if include_removed is set, transactions affecting the wallet which were removed are returned in the "removed" array.

Arguments:
1. "blockhash"            (string, optional) The block hash to list transactions since
2. target_confirmations:    (numeric, optional, default=1) Return the nth block hash from the main chain. e.g. 1 would mean the best block hash. Note: this is not used as a filter, but only affects [lastblock] in the return value
3. include_watchonly:       (bool, optional, default=false) Include transactions to watch-only addresses (see 'importaddress')
4. include_removed:         (bool, optional, default=true) Show transactions that were removed due to a reorg in the "removed" array
                                                           (not guaranteed to work on pruned nodes)

Result:
{
  "transactions": [
    "account":"accountname",       (string) DEPRECATED. The account name associated with the transaction. Will be "" for the default account.
    "address":"address",    (string) The bitcoin address of the transaction. Not present for move transactions (category = move).
    "category":"send|receive",     (string) The transaction category. 'send' has negative amounts, 'receive' has positive amounts.
    "amount": x.xxx,          (numeric) The amount in BTC. This is negative for the 'send' category, and for the 'move' category for moves
                                          outbound. It is positive for the 'receive' category, and for the 'move' category for inbound funds.
    "vout" : n,               (numeric) the vout value
    "fee": x.xxx,             (numeric) The amount of the fee in BTC. This is negative and only available for the 'send' category of transactions.
    "confirmations": n,       (numeric) The number of confirmations for the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
                                          When it's < 0, it means the transaction conflicted that many blocks ago.
    "blockhash": "hashvalue",     (string) The block hash containing the transaction. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
    "blockindex": n,          (numeric) The index of the transaction in the block that includes it. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
    "blocktime": xxx,         (numeric) The block time in seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970 GMT).
    "txid": "transactionid",  (string) The transaction id. Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
    "time": xxx,              (numeric) The transaction time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT).
    "timereceived": xxx,      (numeric) The time received in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT). Available for 'send' and 'receive' category of transactions.
    "bip125-replaceable": "yes|no|unknown",  (string) Whether this transaction could be replaced due to BIP125 (replace-by-fee);
                                                   may be unknown for unconfirmed transactions not in the mempool
    "abandoned": xxx,         (bool) 'true' if the transaction has been abandoned (inputs are respendable). Only available for the 'send' category of transactions.
    "comment": "...",       (string) If a comment is associated with the transaction.
    "label" : "label"       (string) A comment for the address/transaction, if any
    "to": "...",            (string) If a comment to is associated with the transaction.
  ],
  "removed": [
    <structure is the same as "transactions" above, only present if include_removed=true>
    Note: transactions that were readded in the active chain will appear as-is in this array, and may thus have a positive confirmation count.
  ],
  "lastblock": "lastblockhash"     (string) The hash of the block (target_confirmations-1) from the best block on the main chain. This is typically used to feed back into listsinceblock the next time you call it. So you would generally use a target_confirmations of say 6, so you will be continually re-notified of transactions until they've reached 6 confirmations plus any new ones
